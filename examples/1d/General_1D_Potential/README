This is an example for solving 1D problems,
where the potential is given on a grid, in
stead of as an analytical function. It acceps
the potential on the format
    x_0	    V(x_0)
    x_1	    V(x_1)
    x_2	    V(x_2)
    x_3	    V(x_3)
    x_4	    V(x_4)
    osv...  osv...

in a txt-file ('Pot_2p_R100_sigurd.txt' was 
used when submitting this). Supply the filename 
in the config file.

Start
-----
To get the show on the road, create a softlink to 
pyprop:
    ln -s /path/to/pyprop/ pyprop
and then write
    make
to compile and wrap the potential(s).
