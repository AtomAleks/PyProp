Pyprop uses the waf framework for configuration and building, and also
fabricate.


Quickstart
==========

The first step is to configure and build blitz++. Simply go to the extern/blitz
folder, and execute 

  ./configure-blitz

To configure pyprop, issue the following (in the pyprop root folder)

  ./waf configure

Then, build pyprop with

  ./waf build

That's it (hopefully)!


Some more details
=================

Pyprop requires several external libraries to function optimally, such as
(optimized) BLAS/LAPACK and Trilinos. You may also run into problems if some
default libraries are named differently than pyprop expects. In such cases,
additional options must be passed to waf during the configure phase. For a list
of these options, run

  ./waf --help

Note that most of these options must be given during the configure phase.
Note also the option to control which pyprop modules should be built; those
found in the pyprop/modules subfolder (all are built by default).
