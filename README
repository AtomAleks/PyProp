Pyprop - A framework for propagating the time dependent Schr√∂dinger equation
(TDSE) written in Python/C++.

Pyprop is a fairly general framework for solving TDSE-like initial value
problems, and related problems. The aim is to have a standard framework taking
care of parallelization, loading and saving the wavefunction, etc.
Discretization schemes and propagation methods are implemented following
a standard interface, which enables users to test different methods without
requiring detailed knowledge about the implementation.

Propagators for N-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, as well as 3D spherical
coordinates are included in the standard package. In addition representations
can be combined to create more exotic systems, such as including radial nuclear
motion in a diatomic molecule (3D + 1D), combining 3 radial dimensions to
simulate a 1D model for a 3-electron atom (1D + 1D + 1D).

Pyprop is written in Python (depending heavily on the numpy module), while all
the computationally intensive routines have been developed in C++ (using the
blitz++ array library)
